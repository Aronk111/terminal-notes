## If you wish to build the project yourself

### Windows:
```
mkdir bin
cd ./src
go build -o ../bin/notes.exe
cd ../bin
./notes.exe
```

### Macos *(afaik, I don't have macOS)*:
```
mkdir bin
cd ./src
go build -o ../bin/notes
cd ../bin
./notes
```

To have the *`notes`* command always available just add the **bin** folder to your system environment variables.
